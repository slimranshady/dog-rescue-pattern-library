The primary buttons use the accent colour so that they draw the user's attention. They stick out of the blue background.

- The regular buttons are for cards, login, banners, and any simple primary actions.
- The light buttons are for secondary links that aren't as important as the primary buttons.
- The ghost buttons are for the small, least important tasks.
